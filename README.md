This repository contains a task I was given for an interview
The task was to:

Build a simple data pipeline using data from Energinet's API. (API docs:
https://api.energidataservice.dk/index.html)

Requirements:
• Use a relevant dataset to our business
• Fetch and store the data
• Perform a small analysis or visualization on top of the data

The dashboard I built will fetch hourly electricity spot prices, store them in a Parquet file, and build a simple Plotly
dashboard showing daily average prices over time.
